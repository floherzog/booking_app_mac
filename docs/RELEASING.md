# Releasing

The app does not update itself. **Booking → Check for Updates…** asks GitHub for
the latest release of `floherzog/booking_app_mac`, compares its tag with the
running version, and offers to open the download page. So "shipping an update"
means: bump the version, build, and publish a GitHub release whose tag is that
version.

The repo is public, so the update check needs no token.

## 1. Commit and push

Everything the release contains has to be on `main` first:

```sh
git status --short          # clean
git push
```

## 2. Bump the version

`package.json` → `"version"`. The tag you publish must match it, or the update
check will compare the wrong things. Nothing else needs touching:
`app.getVersion()` reads this field, and `electron-builder.yml`'s
`artifactName` interpolates it.

```sh
git commit -am "Release 0.2.0"
```

## 3. Build

```sh
npm test && npm run build && npm run dist
```

Artifacts land **outside the repo**, in `~/Builds/booking_app_mac/` — this repo
lives in iCloud Drive, whose extended attributes make `codesign` refuse to sign
the bundle (see the comment in `electron-builder.yml`). The rest of this file
assumes:

```sh
export BUILD=~/Builds/booking_app_mac
```

This produces, in `$BUILD`:

- `Booking-0.2.0-arm64.dmg` — Apple Silicon
- `Booking-0.2.0-x64.dmg` — Intel
- `Booking-0.2.0-arm64.zip`

## 4. Check the signature before anyone else does

This is the step that prevents the "file is damaged" report. A build with no
signature at all is rejected outright by macOS once it carries a quarantine
flag; `scripts/adhoc-sign.cjs` prevents that, and this verifies it worked.

```sh
codesign -dv --verbose=4 "$BUILD/mac-arm64/Booking.app" 2>&1 | grep Signature
#   expect: Signature=adhoc

codesign --verify --deep --strict "$BUILD/mac-arm64/Booking.app"
#   expect: no output

spctl -a -vv "$BUILD/mac-arm64/Booking.app"
#   expect: "rejected (the code is valid but does not seem to be an app)" or
#   "source=no usable signature" — an unnotarised app is *supposed* to fail this.
```

Then simulate the hand-off locally, which is the only way to see what the
recipient sees without involving a second Mac:

```sh
rm -rf /tmp/Booking.app
cp -R "$BUILD/mac-arm64/Booking.app" /tmp/Booking.app
xattr -w com.apple.quarantine "0081;00000000;Safari;" /tmp/Booking.app
open /tmp/Booking.app
```

It must **not** say "damaged". The expected result is the "Apple could not
verify…" dialog, which right-click → Open gets past.

## 5. Publish

```sh
git tag v0.2.0 && git push --tags

gh release create v0.2.0 \
  "$BUILD"/Booking-0.2.0-arm64.dmg \
  "$BUILD"/Booking-0.2.0-x64.dmg \
  "$BUILD"/Booking-0.2.0-arm64.zip \
  --title "Booking 0.2.0" \
  --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
What changed…

**Installing:** download the arm64 .dmg (Apple Silicon) or the x64 .dmg (Intel),
drag Booking into Applications, replacing the old copy. The first launch needs a
**right-click → Open** — the app is signed ad-hoc, not notarised. On macOS 15 and
later you may instead need *System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway*.

```

## 6. Confirm the update path

From the *previously installed* copy of the app, use **Check for Updates…**. It
should report the new version and open the release page.
